# TaskCrafter API

![Project Screenshot](images/taskcrafter.png)


## üëã Introduction

Task Crafter is a versatile application designed to help organize workflow at any stage.
This application offers a user-friendly interface for managers, users and administrators,
providing a comprehensive toolset for efficiently managing your projects.
With Dropbox integration, you can attach files, and with Google Calendar integration, no event will go unnoticed. 
This project is focused solely on the backend.

## ‚ú® Inspiration

This project was inspired by the need for a streamlined, server-side solution to help users manage 
tasks and events efficiently. Task Crafter was designed to simplify the process of organizing workflows 
across various stages, emphasizing ease of use and integration. 
Observing that many existing solutions are overly complicated or lack key integrations, 
I focused on creating a lightweight API that supports both Dropbox for seamless file attachments 
and Google Calendar to ensure no important event is missed. This backend-focused approach allows Task Crafter 
to serve as a solid foundation for future enhancements and client integrations. 
It provides users with a versatile yet straightforward tool for managing their tasks.

4. If you want to use the application solely for yourself, enjoy!
5. If using it corporately, please follow these guidelines:
   *  When creating a new project, assign potential assignees by, for example, 
   creating an initial task with project information.
   * After this, assignees will be able to see the projects they have access to and create tasks for themselves.

After these steps use the link:
